Follow these steps:
 1. Paste the poem you're currently working on, a found poem, or any found text into the text area. I like to find text from multiple different sources and paste it all in together.
 2. Click the button, and see a randomly generated paragraph composed with the words you entered. 
 3. Select fragments from the paragraph that catch your attention, and use them in your poem. Then go back to step 1, and repeat the process until you're satisfied or tired.
